Text summarization is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that summarizes the information in large texts for quicker consumption without losing vital information. Your favourite news aggregator (such as Google News) takes advantage of text summarization algorithms in order to provide you with information you need to know whether the article is relevant or not without having to click the link. 
It is an NLP technique that extracts text from a large amount of data. It helps in creating a shorter version of the large text available.
